# ProcessObservable

Observable abstraction for processes for .NET. Treat your executable or script process as a push 
stream of information (IObservable<ProcessSignal>) or a task (Task<ProcessCompletion>). Both
executable files, scripts and other file types (with associated programs) can be observed or 
awaited asynchronously.

## NuGet

ProcessObservable is available as a NuGet package:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/ProcessObservable/
